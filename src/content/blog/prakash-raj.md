## What I Learned üß†

### Frontend Technologies

- **Astro Framework**:

  - Learned to use Astro's slot system for flexible component composition, enabling reusable layouts `(e.g. BaseLayout with header slots)`.
  - Explored Astro's content collections for dynamic page generation, such as mapping over blog posts or gallery items.
  - Utilized Astro's integration with Markdown and TypeScript for type-safe content and seamless data flow between content and UI.

- **CSS Techniques**:
  - Utilized CSS custom properties (variables) for theming and dynamic styling `(e.g. --item-width, --card-color, --t for transitions)`.
  - Designed layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive, adaptive interfaces `(e.g., gallery and capital page grids)`.
  - Applied gradients, background-clip, and text-shadow for visually appealing headings and cards.
  - Used object-fit, border-radius, and box-shadow to enhance image presentation and card aesthetics.
  - Leveraged transitions and transforms for smooth interactive effects `(e.g. hover/active states in gallery and draw controls)`.
  - Learn about advanced CSS properties like object-fit for images, custom properties for dynamic sizing, and transitions/transforms for animated gallery navigation and item focus effects.

### Git & Version Control Mastery

Learn about branching strategies, merging, and conflict resolution and learned to work with multiple developers on the same codebase and Understand the commit messages, pull requests, and code with GitHub workflows and project organization.

### VS Code - The Developer's Best Friend

Discovered powerful extensions `(e.g. Project Manager, CSS Color Collector, ESLint, Prettier)` that transformed my coding experience and learned to use integrated debugging features for efficient troubleshooting and
learn to Organize projects efficiently with workspace settings and configurations also Created custom snippets and learned keyboard shortcuts for faster development.
