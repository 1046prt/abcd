# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Code Structure

- Organize files by feature rather than type
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

## Documentation

- Maintain a README.md with project setup and usage instructions
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex logic

## Version Control

- Use Git for version control
- Write clear and concise commit messages
- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes
- Rebase branches before merging
